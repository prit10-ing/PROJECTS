### 3.2 Screen Resolution Processing
1. The ScreenResolution column was split into X_res and Y_res.
2. X_res represents horizontal resolution and was cleaned into integer form.
3. Y_res represents vertical resolution and was converted into integer form.
4. Both values were transformed into numeric features suitable for analysis and modeling.
5. These features allow detailed study of display attributes and their impact on price.

### 3.3 PPI Feature Creation
1. Resolution values were cleaned to remove commas and extract numeric digits.
2. X_res and Y_res were converted to integers for consistency.
3. A new PPI (Pixels Per Inch) feature was created to quantify display sharpness.
4. Higher PPI values indicate clearer and more premium display panels.
5. The PPI feature improves the dataset’s predictive strength.

## 4. CPU & GPU Feature Cleaning

### 4.1 CPU Standardization
1. CPU names were simplified by keeping only the first three words.
2. A new Cpu_name feature was created to categorize CPU families.
3. Intel CPUs were grouped into Core i3, Core i5, Core i7, or labeled Intel Processor.
4. AMD CPUs were grouped into A6, A9, A10, A12 series or labeled AMD Processor.
5. This standardization improves interpretability and reduces noise.

### 4.2 Memory Feature Engineering
1. The Memory column was cleaned and split into individual components.
2. HDD, SSD, Hybrid, and Flash Storage capacities were extracted and converted into numeric values.
3. Multi-storage configurations were handled correctly using layered logic.
4. Temporary processing columns were removed to keep the dataset clean.
5. Final numeric features were created: HDD, SSD, Hybrid, Flash_Storage.

## 5. Feature vs Price Analysis

### 5.1 TouchScreen & IPS vs Price
1. Touchscreen laptops have significantly higher average prices.
2. Non-touchscreen laptops are generally more affordable.
3. IPS display laptops show higher prices compared to non-IPS models.
4. Non-IPS displays are associated with budget-friendly laptops.
5. TouchScreen and IPS both act as indicators of premium models.

### 5.2 Correlation Heatmap Analysis
1. Price shows the strongest correlation with RAM (0.74).
2. X_res and Y_res show strong correlation with price (~0.55).
3. PPI moderately correlates with price (0.47), indicating sharper screens cost more.
4. TouchScreen and IPS have weak but positive correlations (~0.25–0.30).
5. X_res and Y_res correlate almost perfectly (0.99) and strongly correlate with PPI (>0.90).

### 5.3 CPU & GPU vs Price
1. Intel Core i7 laptops have the highest average prices.
2. Intel Core i5 laptops follow as the next most premium segment.
3. AMD A-Series and Intel Processor laptops fall into lower price ranges.
4. Nvidia GPUs lead to the highest laptop prices among all GPU types.
5. Laptops with Other GPUs have the lowest prices, indicating entry-level hardware.

# Machine Learning Insights – Model Performance & Hyperparameter Tuning

## 1. Performance of Models Trained on Scaled Data
1. Linear Regression, KNN, SVR, Decision Tree, and Random Forest models were trained using scaled features.
2. Scaling allowed distance-based models (KNN, SVR) to perform correctly without feature magnitude bias.
3. Linear Regression showed moderate performance, indicating a non-linear relationship in the dataset.
4. KNN and SVR generally performed weaker due to the complex interactions within features.
5. Random Forest and Decision Tree performed the strongest among scaled models, showing good handling of non-linear patterns.

## 2. Performance of Tree-Based Models Without Scaling
1. Decision Tree and Random Forest were retrained without scaling since tree models do not depend on feature magnitude.
2. Random Forest maintained strong performance without scaling, confirming its robustness across feature scales.
3. Decision Tree also performed reliably, though slightly more prone to overfitting compared to Random Forest.
4. The performance difference between scaled and unscaled versions of tree models was minimal, as expected.
5. This confirms that scaling is unnecessary—and sometimes wasteful—for tree-based algorithms.

## 3. Hyperparameter Tuning of Random Forest
1. RandomizedSearchCV was applied to optimize key hyperparameters such as n_estimators, max_depth, and min_samples.
2. A wide range of values was explored using 30 random combinations and 5-fold cross-validation.
3. The search identified an optimal hyperparameter set that improved the model’s performance beyond the default configuration.
4. Tuned hyperparameters included optimized values for n_estimators, max_depth, min_samples_split, min_samples_leaf, and max_features.
5. The tuning process enhanced the model’s generalization ability and reduced prediction error.

## 4. Final Model Evaluation After Tuning
1. The best Random Forest model (from tuning) was evaluated on the test set.
2. The tuned model produced a higher R² score compared to the default Random Forest model.
3. The improved R² score indicates that the tuned model captures more variance in the target variable.
4. The tuned model provides more reliable predictions and better generalization on unseen data.
5. Overall, the tuned Random Forest model becomes the final recommended model for price prediction.

## 5. Summary of Best Findings
1. Tree-based models (Decision Tree, Random Forest) outperform Linear Regression, KNN, and SVR for this dataset.
2. Scaling improves some models, but tree-based models do not require scaling and perform strongly without it.
3. Hyperparameter tuning significantly boosts Random Forest performance, making it the best model overall.
4. The final tuned Random Forest model demonstrates the strongest predictive power (highest R² score).
5. This tuned model is ideal for real-world deployment for laptop price prediction tasks.
